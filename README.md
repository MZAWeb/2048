2048
====

This is my first Ruby code ever, so please feel free to critique to help me improve the code quality. I'm learning Ruby and thought it was a fun idea to take a stab at implementing [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/).

My plan is to implement a iOS version using RubyMotion, but first I wanted to make sure I had the game logic figured out, so went for a console version.

### How to install

1. Clone
2. `bundle install`
3. `ruby 2048.rb`

Only tested in Ruby 2.1.1
